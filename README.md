Academic project applying machine learning techniques to Indian financial market data
# Machine Learning Applications in Financial Markets

## Overview
This repository contains an academic project completed as part of my Machine Learning with Python coursework.  
The objective was to apply machine learning techniques to analyze and model Indian financial market data.

## Instruments Covered
- NIFTY 50 Index
- BANK NIFTY Index
- Reliance Industries Ltd.

## Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (returns, volatility, moving averages)
- Classification and regression models
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics
- backtesting 

## Key Learnings
- Financial markets are noisy and difficult to predict precisely
- Return and volatility modeling are more stable than price prediction
- Machine learning is most effective as a decision-support tool, not a profit guarantee

## Limitations
- Models rely solely on historical price data
- Macroeconomic, news, and sentiment factors are not included
- Results are for academic learning purposes only

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- yfinance
- Matplotlib
